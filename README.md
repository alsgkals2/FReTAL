# FReTAL: Generalizing Deepfake Detection using Knowledge Distillation and Representation Learning
 It is for transfer domain adaptation learning by minimizing the knowledge forgetting without any source data.

# Run
 For running the files, please input the commden.
 ## Unlearning

```
 'python run_FReTAL [number_gpu] [name_source] [name_target] [name of Folder] [Bool (freezing some layer mode is 'True')] [option, sub Folder if you want to make] [sub Folder name]'
 ```
 the 'name_source', 'name_target' is prior datast name and current training dataset name.
 Both load the dataset as well as make folder that is saved the weight of the student model while transfer learning'.


# README and description will be updated...
