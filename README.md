## FReTAL
[FReTAL: Generalizing Deepfake Detection using Knowledge Distillation and Representation Learning](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021W/WMF/html/Kim_FReTAL_Generalizing_Deepfake_Detection_Using_Knowledge_Distillation_and_Representation_Learning_CVPRW_2021_paper.html)

A transfer domain adaptation learning by minimizing knowledge forgetting without using source data.

## Run
 For running the files, please input the comment.
```
 'python run_FReTAL [number_gpu] [name_source] [name_target] [name_of_folder] [Bool (freezing some layer mode is 'True')] [subname_of_folder]'
 ```
**'number_gpu'** --> gpu number\
**'name_source'** --> prior dataset name\
**'name_target'** --> current training dataset name\
**'name_of_folder'**--> To distinguish the name of methods (KD, Finetuning, and FReTAL etc..)\
**'Bool'** --> If you freezing some layer, 'True'. We set 'False' in the all experiments.\
**'subname_of_folder'**--> 'name_of_folder' include this 'subname_of_folder'\
\\
It make the folder ([name_source]_[name_target]) as well as load the dataset from the root directory path.
Also, It is saved the weight of the student model while transfer learning.

## README and description will be updated...
